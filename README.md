# Unity-Combat-System-Ternary-games
I created this project with Unity(used both playmaker and c#). This contains a RPG project with a Advanced Player Character and enemy ai and also a companinon tiger ai.

# Features:
1. 
# Player Character
>basic locomotion(run and walk)
>dodge
>vault over objects
>attack

2.
# Enemy AI
> basic ai that attacks and reacts to player hit (uses unity's navigation system)

3.
# Companion AI
>basic tiger cub ai that follows player (uses unity's navigation system)

4.
# Flexibility
>animations can be added/changed with basic unity knowledge
>characters can be changed
>You can also add your own touches to the enemy and player character 



# Note:
1.Use the animations, character models, day night cycle for preview only. 
Change them while publishing your own game
2.Made with unity 2020.3.14f1
3. It is better to buy playmaker before downloading this(though the playmaker plugin is included)

# Bug fixes:
1. There are some bugs in the game which you have to fix yourself as I will not update this project.

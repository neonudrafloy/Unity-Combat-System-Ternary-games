## Features:
###### 1. Player Character

###### 3. Companion AI
basic tiger cub ai that follows player (uses unity's navigation system)

###### 4. Flexibility
1. animations can be added/changed with basic unity knowledge
2. characters can be changed
3. You can also add your own touches to the enemy and player character 

###### 5. Sound Effects
1. NCS background music is included
2. Character and enemy effort sounds are included too.

## Note:
1. Use the animations, character models, day night cycle for preview only. 
Change them while publishing your own game
2. Made with unity 2020.3.14f1
3. It is better to buy playmaker before downloading this(though the playmaker plugin is included)

## Bug fixes:
There are some bugs in the game which you have to fix yourself as I will not update this project.
